Pixie-SSB
=========

Crude porting of the program QCX-SSB intended for the QCX, QCX+, QCX-Mini
and other and the uSDX platform to be used with a standard Arduino One
with a Pixie Transceiver.

Â¿Will it work? I dunno....trying to.

It's a work in progress repository and largely not functional at this point.
